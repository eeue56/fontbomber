fontbomber
==========

A clone of https://github.com/code-curve/font-bomb, but written in Python.


Difference at the moment is that instead of just pasting the URL, you can just put the family names, joined by commas, as the argument. Example - 


```
python fontbomber Exo 2, Lustria
python fontbomber http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Seymour+One|News+Cycle|Hanalei|Chango|Exo+2
```

Works in both Python 2.7 and 3.3.
Will be on PyPi shortly.
